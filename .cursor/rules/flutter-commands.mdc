    message: |
      Always use Flutter commands instead of Dart commands:

      ❌ INCORRECT Commands:
      ```bash
      dart run
      dart run build_runner build
      dart run build_runner watch
      ```

      ✅ CORRECT Commands:
      ```bash
      flutter run
      flutter pub run build_runner build
      flutter pub run build_runner watch
      ```

      Guidelines:
      1. Always use 'flutter run' instead of 'dart run'
      2. For build_runner commands, use 'flutter pub run build_runner'
      3. For migrations, use 'flutter pub run'
      4. Add --verbose flag for better debugging:
         ```bash
         flutter run --verbose
         flutter pub run build_runner build --verbose
         ```

examples:
  - input: "dart run build_runner build"
    output: "flutter pub run build_runner build"
  - input: "dart run"
    output: "flutter run"
  - input: "dart run some_migration"
    output: "flutter pub run some_migration"
