      AI-Generated Tab Requirements:

      1. Layout Structure:
         ```
         [Song Title - Artist]

         Tuning: E A D G B e  # Only if non-standard

         [Section Name]
         e|---5-7---|
         B|---5-----|
         G|---------|
         D|---------|
         A|---------|
         E|---------|


         [Next Section]  # Note: Two empty lines between sections
         ```

      2. Note Position Rules:
         - Minimum position value: 1 (never 0)
         - Required spacing between notes: -
         ```
         Valid:           Invalid:
         e|--1-1--       e|--11--- (❌)
         B|---1--1       B|--0---- (❌)
         ```

      3. Guitar Techniques:
         ```
         Bends:     15b17    (Bend from fret 15 to pitch of fret 17)
         Releases:   r15      (Release bend to fret 15)
         Pull-offs:  p13      (Pull-off to fret 13)
         Combined:   15b17r15p13
         ```

      4. Section Formatting:
         - Two empty lines between sections
         - Clear section labels in [brackets]
         - Consistent string order (e B G D A E)
         - Equal measure lengths across strings

      5. Sound Recognition Guidelines:
         - Bends (b): Listen for gradual pitch rise
         - Releases (r): Listen for gradual pitch descent
         - Pull-offs (p): Listen for quick transition with single attack

examples:
  - input: |
      [Verse]
      e|0-----|
      B|--11--|
    output: |
      [Verse]
      e|1-----|  # Fixed: Changed 0 to 1
      B|--1-2--|  # Fixed: Added spacing between notes

  - input: |
      [Chorus]
      e|--12b14r12--|
      B|------------|
    output: "Valid technique notation for bend and release"
