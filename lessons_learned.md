# FFmpeg Integration Lessons Learned

## Context
This document summarizes our attempts to implement client-side audio extraction in our Flutter PWA using FFmpeg.wasm. The goal was to extract audio from video files directly in the browser for guitar tab generation.

## Attempted Approaches

1. **Initial FFmpeg.wasm Integration**
   - Tried loading FFmpeg scripts from CDN in `index.html`
   - Used `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg`, `@ffmpeg/util`, and `@ffmpeg/core` packages
   - Implemented JavaScript bridge functions for Flutter interop
   - Challenge: FFmpeg object was consistently unavailable in window scope

2. **Script Loading Order Optimization**
   - Moved scripts from head to body
   - Tried different loading orders (core → ffmpeg → util)
   - Added synchronous loading (removed async/defer)
   - Added logging to track script loading sequence
   - Challenge: Still faced issues with FFmpeg initialization

3. **JavaScript to Flutter Bridge Attempts**
   - Created `ffmpeg_setup.js` for initialization and audio extraction
   - Implemented detailed logging system
   - Added retry mechanisms and delays
   - Challenge: Could not reliably initialize FFmpeg instance

4. **Loading State Management**
   - Added checks for FFmpeg availability
   - Implemented loading states in Flutter UI
   - Added error boundaries and user feedback
   - Challenge: Initialization remained unreliable

## Key Takeaways

1. **Browser Limitations**
   - FFmpeg.wasm has significant limitations in browser environments
   - WebAssembly initialization is complex in Flutter web
   - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) can be problematic

2. **Architecture Considerations**
   - Client-side audio extraction might not be the best approach
   - Consider server-side processing for heavy computations
   - WebAssembly in Flutter web needs more mature tooling

3. **Alternative Approaches to Consider**
   - Server-side FFmpeg processing
   - Using Web Audio API for simpler audio operations
   - Implementing a microservice for audio extraction
   - Using existing audio processing services/APIs

## Recommendations

1. **Short-term Solution**
   - Move audio extraction to server-side
   - Use Firebase Functions or similar cloud service
   - Focus on core user experience first

2. **Long-term Considerations**
   - Monitor FFmpeg.wasm development for better web support
   - Consider hybrid approach (client-side for small files, server-side for larger ones)
   - Research alternative client-side audio processing libraries
