# Phase 4: Tutorial Integration & AI-Generated Content

This phase integrates tutorial features into the app, including both creator-uploaded and AI-generated tutorials. Below is a flattened checklist of all tasks for both frontend and backend processes.

## Task Checklist

[ ] FRONTEND: Develop a tutorial section within the video playback screen.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Create reusable components to display tutorial thumbnails, titles, channel info, and view counts.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Include an interactive element (e.g., button or link) to view more details or launch an external source.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Build a placeholder view for an animated fretboard to be enhanced later.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Show loading spinners and error messages while tutorials are being fetched or generated.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Ensure that the tutorial UI is responsive and consistent with the overall app design.  
[ ] BACKEND: Set up integration with OpenAI's APIs (ChatGPT for text generation, Whisper for transcription).  
[ ] BACKEND: Validate inputs to the AI endpoints, implement rate limiting, and manage retry logic.  
[ ] BACKEND: Save AI-generated or manually uploaded tutorial metadata in Firestore linked to corresponding videos.  
[ ] BACKEND: Design Firestore collections to hold detailed tutorial information.  
[ ] BACKEND: Implement Firebase Cloud Functions to handle long-running AI requests and data processing.  
[ ] BACKEND: Implement moderation workflows and error logging, and track tutorial generation events with Firebase Analytics.
