# Phase 3: Video Upload & Creation

This phase focuses on enabling users to record, select, and upload their guitar video content. The steps below have been flattened into one checklist with clear frontend and backend designations.

## Task Checklist

[ ] FRONTEND: Develop a dedicated video upload screen with clear call-to-action buttons.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Integrate file selection controls and video preview capabilities into the upload UI.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Display progress indicators and feedback animations during the upload process.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Validate accepted video formats on the client side.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Validate file size limits on the client side and provide immediate error notifications if invalid.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Use StateNotifier with Riverpod to manage the upload state and progress.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Ensure the UI updates in real time as the video upload progresses.  
[ ] BACKEND: Configure secure Firebase Storage buckets for saving video content.  
[ ] BACKEND: Implement file upload logic with proper error handling and retry mechanisms.  
[ ] BACKEND: After a successful upload, create a new document in Firestore with video metadata (e.g., uploader info, timestamp, thumbnail URL).  
[ ] BACKEND: Enforce Firebase Storage rules to restrict uploads to authenticated users only.  
[ ] BACKEND: Record upload events and errors using Firebase Analytics for monitoring.
