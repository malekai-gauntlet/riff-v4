# Phase 2: Home Feed & Video Playback

This phase focuses on creating the home feed that displays a personalized list of guitar videos. The following flattened checklist outlines all actionable steps for both the frontend and backend tasks.

## Task Checklist

[ ] FRONTEND: Develop the FeedScreen using responsive layouts (e.g., MediaQuery, LayoutBuilder).  
[ ] FRONTEND: Build reusable video card widgets that display thumbnails, titles, and interaction buttons.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Implement a persistent bottom navigation bar for easy navigation.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Add scroll listeners to trigger fetching additional videos for infinite scrolling.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Use shimmer effects or progress indicators during data load for a smooth UX.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Integrate Flutter's video_player package to handle video playback.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Provide clear UI controls for play, pause, and slow-motion playback.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Manage the video player's lifecycle and state (buffering, playing, paused) effectively.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Leverage the cached_network_image package for caching video thumbnails to enhance load times.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Optimize widget rebuilds using constant constructors where applicable.  
[ ] BACKEND: Create and optimize Firestore queries to fetch video feed data in real time.  
[ ] BACKEND: Implement pagination (e.g., limit to 10â€“15 items per query) to support infinite scrolling.  
[ ] BACKEND: Ensure likes, comments, and view counts are updated within Firestore.  
[ ] BACKEND: Register video playback and user interaction events with Firebase Analytics.  
[ ] BACKEND: Implement graceful error handling on the backend and communicate failures to the frontend.
