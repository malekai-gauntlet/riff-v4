# Tech Stack for Riff

This document defines the finalized technology stack for the Riff application, a niche TikTok-inspired platform for guitarists. The chosen stack is designed to ensure high performance, scalability, and ease of integration while keeping development efficient and aligned with our product requirements.

---

## 1. Framework
- **Flutter**  
  - Flutter is our core framework for building a cross-platform mobile application. It allows us to deliver high-quality performance and smooth animations while maintaining a single codebase for both Android and iOS.

---

## 2. Authentication
- **Firebase Authentication**  
  - Provides secure and scalable user authentication using email/password and other social providers.  
  - Integration with Firebase allows for synchronized user state management across the app.

---

## 3. Database
- **Cloud Firestore**  
  - A NoSQL document-based database that offers real-time data synchronization and offline support.  
  - Ideal for managing our video feeds, user profiles, and other dynamic data.

---

## 4. Cloud Storage for Video Content
- **Firebase Storage**  
  - Provides secure and scalable storage for video files and thumbnails.  
  - Deep integration with Firebase Authentication and Firestore makes managing media assets straightforward.

---

## 5. Video Playback
- **Flutter's video_player**  
  - A native Flutter package maintained by the Flutter team.  
  - It offers robust video playback capabilities and is well-supported by the community, making it a reliable choice for streaming video content.

---

## 6. State Management
- **StateNotifier + Riverpod (with Freezed)**  
  - This combination allows us to manage immutable state effectively and separate business logic from UI components.  
  - Freezed is used to generate immutable data models, while Riverpod provides a robust dependency injection and state management solution.

---

## 7. Analytics & Error Logging
- **Firebase Analytics**  
  - Integrated Firebase Analytics enables us to track user behavior, engagement, and provides insights into usage patterns.  
  - This helps in continuously improving the user experience based on real-time data.

---

## 8. Cloud Functions
- **Firebase Cloud Functions**  
  - Enables us to run server-side code in a scalable, event-driven environment.  
  - Useful for tasks such as processing video metadata, handling AI-powered tutorial generation through OpenAI, and other backend operations.

---

## 9. Continuous Integration / Deployment (CI/CD)
- **GitHub Actions & Vercel**  
  - **GitHub Actions**: Used for automated CI/CD pipelines to test, build, and deploy our application seamlessly.  
  - **Vercel**: Employed for deploying the web version of our application, ensuring fast and reliable updates.

---

## 10. AI-Powered Content Tutorials
- **OpenAI**  
  - Utilizes OpenAI APIs (e.g., ChatGPT and Whisper) to generate high-quality, AI-enhanced tutorials.  
  - Enhances the user learning experience by providing detailed, dynamically generated content for guitar lessons.

---

## Additional Considerations
- **Caching & Media Handling**:  
  - While not a core pillar of the tech stack, our codebase leverages packages such as `cached_network_image` for caching video thumbnails and handling image assets efficiently.
- **Third-Party Integrations**:  
  - Future enhancements may include integrations for messaging (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) and further UI optimizations as our project scales.
