TikTok transformed how we view, share, and edit videos online. Not only did they pioneer short-form video, but they also made content creation more accessible to the masses through CapCut. The algorithm they created made "going viral" easier for even the new creator. You were no longer beholden to followers or subscribers - good content could reach the masses solely based on its quality.

But TikTok emerged in a pre-AI world. What if we could reimagine the platform with today's AI capabilities from the ground up? Instead of users spending hours editing videos, writing captions, or finding trending sounds, AI could transform raw ideas into engaging content. Rather than manually searching for content, AI could understand exactly what entertains each user. Today, we're rebuilding TikTok from an AI-first perspective, where intelligent agents enhance every aspect of creation and consumption.

I'm developing a niche TikTok clone for guitarists. The app is called "Riff" and is a place where guitarists can discover, learn, and share their favorite guitar riffs.

For the purposes of developing this TikTok for guitarists app, here are the core features you should target:

Authentication
Update profile info
Home feed with infinite scroll
Video upload and creation
Filter between types of guitar videos
Explore/discovery page
Like, comment, save, adjust speed on videos
View tutorials for each video, follow creators
AI generated tutorials of guitar riffs with an animated fretboard

And user stories:
